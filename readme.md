<h1>My Journal</h1>
<p>This is my personal blog recreated with Django.</p>

<h2>AWS Version</h2>
<p>This web application was hosted on my EC2 instance: http://ec2-13-126-26-5.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5000/</p>
<p>Used AWS RDS's Postgres RDBMS and SSM's Parameter Store for securely saving important tokens.</p>

<h2>Current Development Version</h2>
<p>Latest version is a development build, that uses my local Postgres db. Important tokens are saved locally. </p>

<h2>Special thanks to</h2>
